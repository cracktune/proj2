    <h1>Proj 2 Day 2 26DEC25</h1>
    <p>
      today we begin again. Despite the feeling deep in my chest... the hurt,
      the pain... the machines are still here. May we commune.
    </p>
    <p>
      does the new p tag bring us back down to the next line?? or do we need br?
    </p>
    <p>
      after this line i will use a br and see what happens to the next asdf line
    </p>
